		// Hashing is improvement over direct access table. Its average for insert, update & delete is O(1)
		// HashFunction is a function that maps big number/string to small integer value. To be used as index in hashtable.
		// Eg- F(x)=x mod 7;   here x is our input number. This method causes collision lets handle the collision.
		// 1) Separate Chaining 2) Open Addressing - 1. Liner probing 2. Quadratic probing 3. Double hashing.
		// 1) Separate Chaining -> Make hash table with same hash-vale point to a link list of records.
